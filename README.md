# CAPTCHA OCR Web App

This is a simple web application that loads an image from a URL parameter, performs OCR to extract text, and allows the user to verify the text as a CAPTCHA.

## Usage

- Enter an image URL with the `?url=` parameter in the address bar.
- The app will load the image, perform OCR, and display the extracted text.
- Type the OCR result into the input box and click Submit to verify.

## Attachments
